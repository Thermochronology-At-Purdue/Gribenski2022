Wrap_PD_MDD code use in Gribenski et al., 20xx (European Alps)

wrap_PD_MDD_LGMScenario_MBTP1_fig3: Code quasi similar to the original one (Wrap_PD_MDD) including main functions (MDD and PDD).

This code package is the one used to create figure 3 (four EDT scenarios with two constant EDT (modern and paleo) and two scenarios with EDT change based on expected changes since LGM)

Main change in the organisation between main wrap code and two functions MDD and PD: command to make plots is now moved the main wrap code (before it was in the MDD code). All data are also saved thorughout teh simulation run for the diffreent scenarios

Main change in the Wrap code (also decsribe at teh top of the code):
%1) Load specific sample info directly from excel file
%2) Load observation(measured) data sample info directly from excel file
%!NEED to enter manually dataObs.r!%
%3) Load Diffusion kinetics data (dataKD) directly from excel file
%-> + l.50: added function for normalisation to dataObs.r (function
%FormatNormLnD0aa)
%->l.53-56: merged all info (sample Spe, samples Obs, sample KD)
%->l.58-70: possibility to calculate internally ratio 3He and 10Be age (function
%AgeCalc)
%4) Load EDT scenarios directly from text file (from visit SUERC)and run
%simulation
%-> l.78-89, for multiple EDT scenarios, loop for automatic storage of data 
%5) Plot results simulation and observed concentrations


Careful: plot of retentions not there, so code would need to be adjusted
