MDD kinetics code use in Gribenski et al., 20xx (European Alps)

SetupMDD_NatDec2020: Code quasi similar to the original one (SetupMDD) and same functions.

Only modifs:
- Line 67-> comment for remembering to keep Ea constant
- Lines 373-374 -> command added to print resulting diffusion kinetics parameters results (to guide iterative tests)

For the study itself, I in fact modified the code further to force the code to automatically find the best diffusion kinetic parameters for an increasing range of Ea (looping) with an imposed number of domain (Ea kept fixed between the different domain, LnD0aa and gas fraction allowed to be vary (although I gave a range to avoid that the code crash/run indefinitely)).
But we agree that I would transfer you the simplest version.
